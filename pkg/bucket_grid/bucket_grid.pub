{abstract, 
 "Implements an N-dimensional bucket storage system. "
 "Neighbouring buckets can be split and merged in any dimension, and "
 "using any Erlang term as split value; "
 "grid traversal and range matching allow for efficient multikey "
 "queries. <br><br>The physical representation is implemented via a callback "
 "interface (see example)."}.
