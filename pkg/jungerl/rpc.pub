 "This is a stub generator for the ONC/RPC protocol. Given a "
 "protocol specification in the RPC syntax (RFC1831), the stub generator "
 "will create client-side and server-side code for encoding and decoding "
 "procedure calls into XDR-encoded network messages. Version 1.1 is rewritten "
 "for R7 - faster XDR routines which generates less garbage."}.
