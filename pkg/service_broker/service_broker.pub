{abstract, "Brokering and supervision of services for service "
 "providers and their users. When either part of the service dies "
 "or selects to disconnect from the service, the other part is notified "
 "about this. The service broker may be for many purposes, such as dynamic "
 "syncronizing of application startup, protocol negotiations, "
 "inter application supervision, implementation of safe calls etc. "
 "A man page (as comment in the module) and test program are also supplied."}.
