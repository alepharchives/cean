{abstract,"Depcheck is a program for finding incorrect module dependencies. "
 "Given a source module, it will attempt to locate the dependency modules "
 "and validate the function calls. The dependency modules are scanned "
 "syntactically, not parsed. (The source module needs to be compilable "
 "and is analysed using exref)."}.
