{abstract, "<p>This module implements an abstract data type in Erlang which "
  "represents a <i>measurement</i> taken from the observed world. "
  "These measurements have, as part of their make-up, both a <i>scalar</i> "
  "component which determines their magnitude, and a <i>units of "
  "measurement</i> (<i>UoM</i>) component which determines their "
  "dimensionality (and may further determine their magnitude within "
  "that dimensionality.)</p>"}.
