{abstract, "This provides a socket based multithreaded inter Erlang "
 "node Remote Procedure Call mechanism which is independent of the "
 "standard Erlang distribution. It provides some security mechanisms, "
 "and can optionally be setup to queue calls in the event of a link "
 "failure and send them sometime later at a predefined rate while "
 "preserving the order of all commands."}.
