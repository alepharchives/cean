{summary, "an efficient parser for json documents with a SAX-like API"}.
{abstract, "The parser has a SAX-like API. It also has a mechanism to parse input data in blocks "
 "- if it reaches the end of the input data, it will call a function to provide the next block. "
 "The combination of these properties results in a parser that can input of arbitrary size, or a stream of data.<br>"
 "Included is a handler function that translates the SAX events into the same output format produced by mochijson2. "
 "Looks like this: {struct, [{<<\"key1\">>, <<\"value1\">>}, {<<\"key2\">>, 123}]}.<br>"
 "The parser consists of just 1 file, with some edoc documentation and a couple of very simple examples "
 "included. It only works on UTF-8 encoded input (which implies that it can also parse ASCII, of course).<br>"
 "It can be redistributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License."}.
